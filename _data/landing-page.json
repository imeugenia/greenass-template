  "secondaryDescription": "We are #Greenass.  Many big companies claim that their toilet paper is made from „sustainable forests“ but all that it means is that you will wipe your butt with beautiful trees that have been cut down just to end up down the drain...  Do you want to carry that guilt on your ass?? We think not, we know you want a **\\#greenass**.   But how do we recognize what toilet paper is ok to buy? Why is it so much better to use recycled? We've got the answers for you.",

      "question": " What paper is o.k. to buy and use?",
      "answer": "You should look out for the “FSC Recycled” label,  or even better, the “Blauer Engel” certificate. You’ll often find “FSC Mix,” but that label indicates that the fibers come from a mix of recycled, controlled and certified wood and doesn’t make public what percentage each is, it therefore generally implies that it’s mainly made of virgin wood, sometimes even from uncertified forests, and that very little raw material comes from recycled fibers.
